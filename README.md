# 🦞 OpenClaw AI Agent on Azure — Terraform + Docker + Tailscale

> Deploy a secure, 24/7 always-on AI agent on an Azure VM using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Docker for containerization, and Tailscale for zero-trust private networking.

Inspired by: [Deploy Your Own 24/7 AI Agent on AWS EC2 with Docker & Tailscale — The Secure Way](https://blog.thecloudopscommunity.org/deploy-your-own-24-7-ai-agent-on-aws-ec2-with-docker-tailscale-the-secure-way-e8e3dadde6a4) — adapted here for **Microsoft Azure** with **Terraform** as the IaC layer.

## ✅ What You'll Have by the End

- A hardened Ubuntu 22.04 server provisioned on Azure via Terraform
- Docker running OpenClaw in an isolated, persistent container
- Secure private access via Tailscale — no inbound ports exposed to the internet
- A fully functional AI assistant reachable from your browser or phone

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) ≥ 1.5 | Infrastructure provisioning |
| [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) | Authenticate with your Azure account |
| SSH key pair | Used for VM access (`~/.ssh/openclaw-azure`) |
| [Tailscale account](https://tailscale.com/) | Free tier is sufficient |
| Anthropic API key | Recommended — Claude Sonnet/Opus gives best agent performance |
| OpenAI API key | Optional, can be used as a backup model provider |

---

## ⚙️ What Terraform Provisions

The `terraform/` directory defines the full Azure infrastructure:

- **Resource Group** — logical container for all resources
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** + **Subnet** — isolated network layer
- **Public IP** — static IP for SSH access
- **openclaw user** - Openclaw user provisioned with sudo rights
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** — restricts inbound traffic to port 22 and 2222
- **Linux VM** — Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Recommended specs: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 15GB storage)
- **SSH key authentication** — password auth disabled via terraform

---

## 🚀 Step 1 — Provision the VM with Terraform

```bash
# Authenticate with Azure
az login

# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialise Terraform
terraform init

# Preview the changes
terraform plan

# Apply and provision the infrastructure
terraform apply
```

Once complete, note the **public IP** output — you'll need it to SSH in.

---

## 🔐 Step 2 — SSH into the VM

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/openclaw-azure openclaw@<PUBLIC_IP>
# Set default policies 
sudo ufw default deny incoming 
sudo ufw default allow outgoing 
# Allow the CURRENT port (Safety Net) 
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp 
# Allow the FUTURE port 
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp 
# Enable the firewall 
sudo ufw enable
When prompted, type y to confirm. You now have two layers of firewall protection.


Before we change ports, we need to prove that our new user can log in with the SSH key.
Now that we’ve verified key-based login works, it’s time to harden SSH.

# Change SSH port to 2222
sed -i 's/^#\?Port.*/Port 2222/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Disable root login
sed -i 's/^#\?PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Disable Systemd Socket Activation (CRITICAL)
Here’s the gotcha: Ubuntu 24.04 uses “socket activation” which holds Port 22 open regardless of what you put in sshd_config. You must disable this:

# Stop the socket listener
sudo systemctl stop ssh.socket 
sudo systemctl disable ssh.socket 
# Restart the SSH service to apply your new config 
sudo systemctl restart ssh

Only if that works, go back to your server terminal and lock down Port 22:
Then go to NSG and delete the inbound rule for Port 22.

```

> Replace `<PUBLIC_IP>` with the value from `terraform output` or the Azure portal.

## 🐳 Step 3 — Install Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

# Add Docker GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add Docker repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine + Compose plugin
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

# Enable and start Docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Add current user to docker group (so no sudo needed)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Add your user to the docker group (avoids needing sudo for every docker command)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply the group change without logging out
newgrp docker
```

Verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

## 🔗 Step 4 — Install and Connect Tailscale

Tailscale creates a secure private mesh network between your VM and your devices — so OpenClaw's web UI is never publicly exposed.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

Follow the authentication URL printed in the terminal to approve the device in your Tailscale dashboard. Once connected, note your VM's **Tailscale IP** (e.g. `100.x.x.x`) — this is how you'll access the OpenClaw web UI later.

---

## 🦞 Step 5 — Set Up OpenClaw with Docker Compose

Clone the official OpenClaw repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
# Create the folder structure 
mkdir -p /home/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace 
# Give full read/write access (fixes the "Permission Denied" error) 
sudo chmod -R 777 /home/openclaw/.openclaw 
sudo chown -R openclaw:openclaw ~/openclaw 
sudo chmod -R 775 ~/openclaw
```

Run the official setup script, which uses Docker Compose and walks you through initial configuration:

```bash
./docker-setup.sh
```

The script creates two persistent directories on the host:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.openclaw` | Configuration, memory, API keys, agent settings |
| `~/openclaw/workspace` | Working directory — files the agent creates appear here |

### First-Run Configuration

During the interactive setup wizard, you'll configure:

- **Model provider** — choose Anthropic (recommended for Claude Sonnet/Opus) or OpenAI
- **API keys** — stored in a `.env` file, never committed to Git
- **Messaging channel** — Telegram is the easiest to configure (create a bot via `@BotFather` and provide the token)
- **Gateway settings** — default port is `18789`

A series of prompts will appear. Select EXACTLY these options to avoid crashes:

Onboarding mode → Manual
Setup Local gateway → (this machine)
Workspace directory → (Press Enter to accept default)
Model/auth Provider → Anthropic
Anthropic API Key → (Enter your key)
Gateway port → 18789
Gateway bind → Tailnet
Gateway auth → Token
Tailscale exposure → Off
Gateway Token → (Create a secure token)
Configure chat channel → (Whatsapp/Telegram — your choice)
Configure Skills → No
Hooks → Skip for Now

Critical Warning: Do NOT select “Serve” for Tailscale exposure. This bypasses complex proxy logic that causes crashes. Select “Off” — Tailscale already handles secure access.

Wait for completion. The container will start, but DO NOT LOGIN YET.
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6 — The “Insecure Auth” Injection

```bash
At this stage, the bot is running but will block your browser because you’re connecting over HTTP (not HTTPS). Since Tailscale already encrypts our traffic end-to-end, we can safely enable HTTP authentication.

First, install jq inside the container:
docker compose exec -u root openclaw-gateway bash -c "apt update && apt install -y jq"

Then inject the setting:
docker compose exec -T openclaw-gateway bash -c ' jq ".gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth = true" \ /home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json > /home/node/.openclaw/tmp.json && \ mv /home/node/.openclaw/tmp.json /home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json'

Restart the bot to apply changes:
docker compose restart
```

Verify the container is running and healthy:

```bash
docker ps

Get Your Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4


```

---

## 🌐 Step 7 — Access the Web UI via Tailscale

Because no public port is exposed for the web UI, access it through your Tailscale IP:

```
http://<TAILSCALE_IP>:18789
```

The dashboard requires a session token. Retrieve it with:
Enter the Gateway Token you created during setup and click Connect.

```bash
docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli dashboard --no-open
```

Copy the full URL including the `?token=...` parameter and open it in your browser.

---

Congratulations! You now have a private AI assistant running on your own infrastructure, accessible only through your secure Tailscale network.

You can now send instructions to your AI agent directly from your phone via Telegram/Whatsapp — 24/7.

---

## 🔧 Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# View live logs
docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway

# Stop the agent
docker compose stop

# Restart after config changes
docker compose restart

# Update to the latest OpenClaw version
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

# Open a shell inside the container
docker compose exec openclaw-gateway bash

# Run CLI commands
docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli <command>
```
Set API Spend Limits
Agentic AI can sometimes get stuck in loops and burn through API credits rapidly. Protect yourself:

Go to your Anthropic Console
Navigate to Settings → Limits
Set a hard monthly budget (e.g., $20)
Do the same for OpenAI if you configured it as a backup.

---

## 🧹 Tear Down the Infrastructure

When you're done, destroy all Azure resources cleanly:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```

Your configuration data in `~/.openclaw` on the VM will be lost when the VM is deleted. Back up anything important beforehand.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **No public web ports** — OpenClaw's UI (port `18789`) is only reachable over Tailscale
- **SSH only** — the NSG restricts all inbound traffic except SSH (port 22)
- **SSH key auth only** — password authentication is disabled on the VM
- **Docker isolation** — the agent runs inside a container, limiting its blast radius on the host
- **`.env` file** — keep API keys out of version control; add `.env` to your `.gitignore`

---

## 💡 Why This Project

| Aspect | Approach |
|---|---|
| Infrastructure | Terraform (IaC) — fully reproducible and destroyable |
| Cloud | Microsoft Azure (instead of AWS) |
| Runtime | Docker — isolated, portable, easy to update |
| Networking | Tailscale — zero-trust, no open inbound ports |
| AI Backend | Anthropic Claude (or OpenAI as fallback) |

---

## 🔮 Potential Improvements

- **`cloud-init` / `user_data`** — automate Docker + Tailscale installation at VM boot time via Terraform
- **Private VM** — remove the public IP entirely; access exclusively over Tailscale
- **Azure Key Vault** — store API keys as secrets instead of a `.env` file
- **CI/CD pipeline** — automate `terraform apply` and container updates on push
